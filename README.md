Live, build, and thrive in a city made of blocks, inhabited by players like you.

CityRPG is a mod for the game Blockland that simulates the life of a blocky city. Each city is built, run, and populated by the players. Itâ€™s a sandbox-RPG-simulation blend with limitless potential.

In CityRPG 4, you can explore a range of jobs and opportunities as you work your way to the top! You can join the fun on an existing server, or create your own server with any theme, rules, and style that you like

# Optional Integrations
CityRPG 4 has optional support for the following add-ons. In order to use them, enable both GameMode_CityRPG4 and the desired add-on under Custom in the game-modes menu.

* [Mail System](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=670) - Players can buy and sell notes, letters, and cards in stores. Selling these items does not require a licensed job like the Arms Dealer.
* Tier+Tactical Weapons: [Tier 1](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=1206), [Tier 1A](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=1207), [Tier 2](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=1209), [Tier 2A](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=1210)  - Most items can be sold in stores as weapons, including some of the easter eggs if they are enabled. Ammo is currently not supported, so it is recommended that you disable it in prefs.

## Abuse Prevention
* [doPlayerTeleport Event](https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=253312.0) - The "Relative" checkbox is disabled to prevent abuse (i.e. teleporting into unwanted areas of players' builds)
* [Zone Events](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/rtb/view.php?id=119) - Events prone to abuse are disabled.

# Developer Documentation
CityRPG 4 is being built fully open source, and we encourage you to fork the repository and make your own changes. We would love to see your contributions!

Below is an incomplete documentation of key functions in CityRPG 4.

## Quick Start Guides

### General dev tips - Running from a folder

You can develop the game-mode and/or extensions for it straight out of your add-ons folder. Simply extract the desired add-on for development into a folder, and *delete* the .zip. You should be left with a folder named after the add-on, i.e. `GameMode_CityRPG4`. The game will see it as an add-on just like it would a normal .zip.

### General dev tips - Reloading the game-mode
For developing and testing features, you can make changes and then re-load the game-mode through the "Game-Mode >>" button in the admin menu. This allows you to restart only the server, and not your whole game.

This does not work if you are adding completely new files.

### General dev tips - Hot-reloading
You can reload a script to change things without closing the game at all by executing the desired script. A couple ways you can do this:
- Run `exec(...);` in your console with the path to the file. For example: `exec("add-ons/gamemode_cityrpg4/")
- An easier alternative: Use [Jincux's Development Tools](https://blocklandglass.com/addons/addon.php?id=252) add-on. See ["devtools.cs"](https://github.com/cityrpg/CityRPG/blob/master/devtools.cs) in the root folder of this repository. It covers most of CityRPG's important scripts, and you can add your own in-game.

Note - If the script contains a package, you may encounter unexplained issues due to the package load order changing. If this happens, you may still need to reload from the game-mode menu or restart the game.

### How updates are handled
Semantic versioning is used here. A major version increase (i.e. 1.x.x -> 2.x.x) means something important has changed that is likely to break some mods. Key changes are outlined under "Developer info" in the changelog for each update.

### How to add jobs
There is an example add-on in the CityRPG_Jobs_Template folder. This is an add-on that you can drop into your game, rename, and edit as you like.

From scratch, the short version: Package the JobSO::loadJobFiles function. You can overwrite it or simply add onto it (`Parent::JobSO::loadJobFiles(%this)`). Add JobSO::createJob(%file) calls leading to your job files. Your job files shold follow the same format as jobs/ or CityRPG_Jobs_Template/

See also: [JobSO and Custom Jobs](#JobSO-and-Custom-Jobs)

## Client/GameConnection

### GameConnection::cityMenuOpen(names, functions, exitMsg, autoClose, canOverride)
Displays a generic menu, currently using a chat-based approach. Returns true if the menu opens successfully. No eval or script object handling is necessary.

While this currently resembles the mechanics of classic CityRPG menus (chat-based, type a number), the method of displaying menus is subject to change. For best results, make sure to check client.cityMenuOpen before attempting. Take note of the default 8-line chat limit.

**Args:**
- exitMsg (str): The message to display when the menu closes
- menu (str, fields): A set of fields containing names for each menu item.
- functions (str, fields): The function that will be called corresponding with each name option. The following are passed to this function, in order: %client (Client object), %input (User input that triggered this menu option), %id (The active ID for the current menu).
- menuID (str): A unique identifier for the menu, for reference elsewhere. Generally set to the ID of the brick that triggered it.
- autoClose (Bool): If set to 'true', the menu will close as soon as the function executes.
- canOverride (Bool): If set to 'true', the menu will close automatically if another menu is opened. If false, other menus will be blocked from opening.

**Example:**
```
%menu = "Option 1" TAB "Option 2";
%functions = "announce" TAB "talk";
findClientByName(Blockhead).cityMenuOpen(%menu, %functions, "", "", true, false);
```

Result:
Typing "1" will show the client's ID in yellow text. ("announce()")
Typing "2" will show the client's ID with a "CONSOLE: " chat message. ("talk()")

To prompt the user for text, direct client.cityMenuFunction to a new function with the arguments `client` and `input`. The user's next raw text input will be passed to the function as `input`.

Check `server/cityModules/lotRegistry.cs` and `server/brickScripts/info/jobs.cs` for complex utilizations of the cityMenuOpen function.

#### Pre-existing generic functions
This is a list of existing functions for menus. These functions should be used where possible to avoid redundancy in creating extra menu functions.

- CityMenu_Close - Closes the menu.
- CityMenu_Placeholder - Displays the text "Sorry, this feature is currently not available. Please try again later."

### GameConnection::isCityAdmin()
Returns true or false whether the target client is in Admin Mode. For most uses, it is recommended that you use this in place of checking isAdmin.

## Tools

### CityRPGBatonImage::onCityPlayerHit(obj, slot, col, pos, normal)
Allows the creation of additional checks when players are batoned. MUST return `true` if a check is passed, otherwise baton actions will overlap each other.

Shares the same arguments as the CityRPGBatonImage::onHitObject function.

### CityRPGLBImage::onCityPlayerHit(obj, slot, col, pos, normal)
See CityRPGBatonImage::onCityPlayerHit

### gameConnection::arrest(client, cop)
Called when `client` is arrested by `cop`.

## Misc

### City_illegalAttackTest(atkr, victim)
Called when players are attacked, determines if an attack is to incur demerits as an assault. Returns `false `

## JobSO and Custom Jobs

### JobSO::loadJobFiles(so)
This is the function that populates the job list with jobs. If desired, this function can be packaged and/or overridden to update the game-mode's job list. Jobs can be executed by running `JobSO.createJob`

### JobSO::createJob(so, file)
Adds a job from a script file. For a reference of what a job script file looks like, refer to the files contained within `GameMode_CityRPG4/server/jobs`.

The path will check for a script filename first in `GameMode_CityRPG4/jobs`, and if none is found there, it will check for a direct path.

This can be used to create custom jobs without directly editing the game-mode files.

#### Examples:
`JobSO.createJob("PdOfficer");` - Adds the job found in `GameMode_CityRPG4/jobs/PdOfficer.cs`

`JobSO.createJob("Add-Ons/CityRPG_Jobs_MyCustomJobs/PdOfficer.cs");` - Adds the job found in `Add-Ons/Suport_CityRPG_MyCustomJobs/PdOfficer.cs`
