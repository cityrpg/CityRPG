	<b>Changes for Hosting</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a new pref, "Disable Default Weapons", that will disable the default game weapons like the Gun from being sold in shops. This is ideal for using custom weapon packs. Beware: This does not prevent jobs from spawning with these weapons. For that, you will need a [custom job pack](https://github.com/cityrpg/CityRPG-4/tree/master/CityRPG_Jobs_Template).</li>
		<li>While in Admin Mode, you are now shown the ID of any lots you walk over.</li>
		<li>You can now access an Admin Menu through the actions menu.</li>

</version>
<version:0.3.0>
	<b>Interactions Update</b>
	<b>Job Improvements</b>
	The jobs menu and commands have been improved. Job sign-ups now give you more details about the qualifications and perks, and you can now type partial names when signing up for a job.

	<b>Event Changes</b>
	<ul>
		<li>New event: onLotFirstEntered</li>
		<li>onEnterLot and onLeaveLot events renamed to onLotEntered and onLotLeft</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Center Print Menus (Experimental)</b>
	The chat-based menus have migrated to a new experimental menu system. You can now navigate through menus using the build keys to move up and down and select an option. This applies to the bank, real estate, lot menus, and all other in-game menus. For things that require text input, you must still type in chat.

	<b>Actions Menu</b>
	There is a new, central menu that can be used to access various general functions for CityRPG. This menu allows you to view your stats and access the Mayor menu if you are the mayor. 

	<b>Mayor Menu</b>
	The mayor now has their own panel that they can access through the player menu. This gives the Mayor easier access to their special powers, pardons and record clearing.

	<b>Full Changelog</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a "Wrench lot" option to the /lot menu for lot owners. This option pulls up the wrench menu so you can more easily access events for the lot.</li>
		<li>Renamed the "onEnterLot" and "onLeaveLot" events to "onLotEntered" and "onLotLeft" for clarity.</li>
		<li>Added the "onLotFirstEntered" input event. This event triggers when someone enters your lot for the first time.</li>
		<li>The number of unique lots you visit is now tracked under /stats.</li>
		<li>When you update a lot (i.e. name change, ownership change, list for sale), the new info is now displayed to yourself and anyone on the lot.</li>
		<li>You can now type in a partial name when signing up for a job.</li>
		<li>If you attempt to sign up for a job that you are not qualified for, you will now see all of the missing qualifications--rather than only the first one detected by the game.</li>
		<li>When you change jobs, you will now see a series of messages detailing what changes with your new job.</li>
		<li>/dropMoney no-longer limits you to a minimum of $50. Instead, there is now a limit to how many cash drops you can have in the world at once.</li>
		<li>Updated the Arms Dealer job description for clarity.</li>
		<li>Pardoning players as the Mayor no-longer costs money in the form of direct payment. Instead, there is a cost to the economy, relative to the prisoner's remaining sentence. A prompt is displayed to explain the cost before pardoning.</li>
		<li>/pardon now requires admin mode to be activated if the player is not the Mayor.</li>
		<li>Lot management settings (renaming, etc.) have moved to a separate "Lot management" option to reduce clutter.</li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	<b>Changes for Hosting</b>
	<ul>

		<li>Fixed "Incorrect amount of arguments!" console error on startup.</li>

	</ul>
</version>
<version:0.2.1>
	Fixed an exploit where players could "buy" the real estate brick as a lot, granting them ownership of the bricks connected to it.
</version>
<version:0.2.0>
	<b>Job Trees, Radio, & Real Estate Improvements</b>
	<b>Real Estate</b>
	The real estate office is back. Real estate has been rewritten, hooking into the existing lot system established in Alpha 1. This means quick, seamless lot sales. You can visit the real estate office to view city-wide stats, manage and list your own lots, or purchase someone else's lot listing.

	<b>Job tracks & radio</b>
	Jobs are now sorted into individual job trees. They show up individually in the jobs menu and have their own team chat. Team chat now functions as a radio that you can use to communicate with other players within your job track. For example, all Police jobs now have a single police radio.

	<b>Bugfixes</b>
	This update contains plenty of bugfixes and general polish. See below for the full changes.

	<b>Full Changelog</b>

	</ul>

	<b>Changes for Hosting</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The way lots work has seen another overhaul. Changes have been made to the way lots are stored, both in your .bls saves and in the config folder. Old lot saves are not compatible and will load as Unclaimed lots.</li>
		<li>Added Admin Mode, a new toggle for Council Member and its features. Admin mode disables building restrictions, hunger effects, and makes the admin invincible.</li>
		<li>The game-mode package is now split into two releases, Full and Minimal--Full is a package for hosting a very simple, playable CityRPG, and Minimal acts as a toolkit for setting up a customized CityRPG server.</li>

		<li>The directory for save files has moved to config/server/CityRPG4_A2.</li>
		<li>The game-mode now detects if the active save file is from an older version of CityRPG and displays a warning about compatibility accordingly.</li>

	</ul>

	<b>Bugfixes</b>
	<ul>

		<li>Fixed the missing icon for the Knife item.</li>
		<li>Added Item_Skis to the required add-ons. (Ski code is used for taser and hunger effects; errors would occur if skis were disabled for whatever reason)</li>

		<li>Fixed certain instances of the damage % on the HUD not updating.</li>
		<li>Fixed blank values under the /stats command.</li>

	</ul>
</version>

<version:0.1.1>
	<b>Alpha 1 Patch</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a new default CityRPG build.</li>
		<li>Replaced the default colorset with Trueno's Colorset</li>
		<li>Drastically optimized the antiquated data saver. CPU usage and response times have significantly improved, fixing instances of the server choking with higher player counts and/or larger maps. This is only a band-aid fix until the saver is replaced, but it brings significant performance improvements.</li>
		<li>The game-mode now modifies the doPlayerTeleport add-on if it is enabled; the "Relative" option is disabled to prevent players from phasing through walls with it.</li>
